            <h1>Traditional Dishes to Look For in the Philippines</h1>
            <p>
              Have you ever tried Filipino food? I’m not surprised if you
              haven’t because for one reason or another, Filipino cuisine hasn’t
              caught on internationally as much as other Asian cuisines like
              Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, or Thai.

                Manga at bagoong refers to a simple but hugely popular dish of
                unripe green mango and bagoong alamang. Bagoong alamang is a
                paste made with fermented shrimp or krill. It’s popular in
                similar forms throughout Southeast Asia and is known for being
                an extremely pungent condiment that’s used in many popular
                Filipino dishes like pinakbet and binagoongan.

                Torta is a Spanish culinary term that can mean many different
                things. Depending on where you are, it can refer to cakes, pies,
                flatbreads, and sandwiches but in Filipino cuisine, it refers to
                a type of omelette.

                whole taro leaves cooked with coconut milk, pork or seafood,
                chili peppers, and a host of aromatics like garlic, onions,
                ginger, and lemongrass. It’s a rich, creamy, and often spicy

                fish and steamed white rice.

                glutinous rice batter, unshelled small shrimp, and a variety of

                If you had to try just one dish in the Philippines, one dish to
                represent Filipino cuisine, the I’d probably tell you to try
                pork sisig. It’s a hugely popular bar chow dish made with
                chopped pork face, ears, and chicken liver served on a cast iron

                Longganisa is derived from the Spanish word longaniza and refers

                Philippines. Longganisa is so popular and integral to Filipino
                cooking that many regions in the country hold annual festivals
                to celebrate and promote it.
